# Megaline Plan Revenue Analysis

## Overview

I was tasked with analyzing revenue data for Megaline, a telecom company offering two prepaid plans: Surf and Ultimate. The goal was to determine which plan generates more revenue to help guide future advertising strategy.

Using data from 2018 on 500 clients, I explored user behavior based on calls, text messages, and internet usage. I calculated monthly revenue per user and used hypothesis testing to compare average revenue between the two plans and across regions.

## Key Insights

- The Ultimate plan generates higher average revenue per user than the Surf plan.
- Surf users incur more overage charges, contributing to higher revenue variability.
- No statistically significant revenue difference was found between NY–NJ region users and others.
- Both plans show similar patterns in call and message usage, while Ultimate users tend to use slightly more internet data.
