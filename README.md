# Megaline Plan Revenue Analysis

## Overview

Megaline, a telecom provider, offers two prepaid mobile plans — Surf and Ultimate. The company wanted to determine which plan generates more revenue in order to guide future marketing and advertising investments.  

Using 2018 data from 500 clients, I analyzed call, text, and internet usage patterns to calculate monthly revenue per user. I also used statistical hypothesis testing to compare revenue performance between the two plans and across regions.

This project focuses on data cleaning, feature engineering, visualization, and statistical testing to deliver actionable insights for business decision-making.

## Key Insights

- **Ultimate plan customers generate higher average monthly revenue** than Surf customers.  
- **Surf users tend to incur more overage charges**, creating higher variability in their monthly revenue.  
- **No statistically significant revenue difference** was found between customers in the NY–NJ region and other regions.  
- Usage patterns for calls and messages are similar across both plans, while **Ultimate users consume slightly more internet data** on average.
